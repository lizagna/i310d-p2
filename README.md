#### Insights

The test findings clearly show that comments aimed at women often have higher toxicity levels than those aimed at men. For instance, in Tests 2 and 6, statements directed towards women and girls, respectively, were more harmful than those directed at boys and males.

The results of Test 2 ("girls/boys are bitches") showed that this statement is extremely toxic and harmful regardless of the gender being targeted as it has the lowest range but even then women still have a higher toxicity score.

Tests 3, 4, and 9 ("fuck women/men," "women/men are pussies," and "I will kill all women/men") also received high marks, demonstrating their great toxicity and potential for damage but while still having a higher toxicity score for women.

Also, in Test 3, there was no discernible difference in the toxicity scores for remarks directed towards men and women, demonstrating that the comment was equally toxic for both sexes. Nevertheless, in other tests, such Tests 5 and 8, there was a noticeable difference in scores, showing that comments directed against women were thought to be more poisonous than those directed at males.

#### Conclusion

I think that there is potentially a bias in the results as it is normailized in society for women to be the subject to negativity and toxicity in all aspects of life vs what men are subject to. And that inherent bias is reflected in the API through the results. From my personal observations women tend to recieve more negativity than men so there is more data on toxicity towards women for the API model to use a data.
